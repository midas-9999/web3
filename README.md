# loan system
so this is a loaning system 
//woring 
1st some lenders will submit their cash and some other details 
as they are the main body they will get some more  features to use in our app then our borrower will
come in the role and he/she will enter his demand and will get the contact details of lenders and then he can contact them and get the best loan

//how to impliment

starting with the 1st layout it will ask you what you are?
1st  go for the lender (press 1)
then create a account (press1)
enter the data (remember the id it will be used in later cases)
contact:- is phone number so must be an integer
rate will be integer 
time is also integer and in years 

after this you will be again at home page 
create 1-2 more lenders

then go to lenders section again check the features 
(by 2 you can check your own  details by using ids)
(by 3 you can compare yourself from other lenders )
(by 4 you can check the intrest rate SI as well as CI
(si usese polymorphism) that you are getting from your input demand


now come to the browwer section 
browwer will enter the amount he want and he will get the data of those lenders who has more money than the reuired amount that can help him
contact details will help him/her to get to it.

///
ans:-  It is fully centralized system as the lender can demand any intrest rate as he want 
but if there was a bank in betwwen which is controlled by any government(so power will be distributed between lenders/govt. bank)
then the lenders will demand in limit.

So I tried to help the  borrower by giving him all the choice , he can select the best one.
